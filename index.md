## showing my work

Whenever I run into a problem I need to solve I do what everyone does: I google it. Frequently some random person's blog comes up detailing how they set about solving the problem. So I figured if I was already doing the work, for my own interest, might as well publish it? 

That's where these notebooks come from, they are mostly worked examples of things I've either had to do through my work -- I'm a chemical engineer by day -- or something I stumbled across and just thought was interesting. Hopefully you find them useful and, if you find any mistakes, let me know!

## technical details

Each post has a [corresponding notebook](https://github.com/selenized/selenized.github.io/tree/main/_notebooks) which should be a stand alone document, complete with images and all that. The notebooks also include a bunch of boiler plate, especially for importing modules and generating plots, if you want to run any of the code presented I recommend downloading the notebook and running that.

The notebooks are [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and running either [Julia](https://julialang.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/).
