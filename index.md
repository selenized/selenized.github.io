## notes and examples

Whenever I run into a problem I need to solve I do what everyone does: I google it. Frequently some random person's blog comes up detailing how they set about solving the problem. So I figured if I was already doing the work, for my own interest, might as well publish it? 

That's where these notebooks come from, they are mostly worked examples of things I've either had to do through my work -- I'm a chemical engineer by day -- or something I stumbled across and just thought was interesting. Hopefully you find them useful and, if you find any mistakes, let me know!
